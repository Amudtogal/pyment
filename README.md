======

This Python program intend to help Python programmers to enhance inside code documentation using docstrings. 
It is usefull for code that is not yours, or old code without docstrings, or some not yet documented code.

It will parse one or several python scripts and retrieve existing docstrings.
Then, for all found functions/methods/classes, it will generate formated docstrings with parameters, default values,...

At the end, patches are generated for each file. Then, man can apply the patches to the initial scripts.
